# HTML Maintenance Page

This is a simple HTML/CSS page, that you can use for maintenance purposes. For your convinience, I added a Bash-Script, that allows you to quickly set it up with your personal values. The design is inspired by Apple's maintenance page. 

## 1. Features:

 - Company/Personal Logo
 - Contact E-Mail
 - Optional: Other Background Design (see screenshots)
 - Free for private and commercial use (see LICENSE.md)

## 2. Download and Installation:

Clone the GIT repository 
```
git clone https://github.com/mlhbeckmann/automatedlinuxsecurity.git --branch release --single-branch
```
Make the Script executable by running

    chmod +x setup.sh

Next, simply run the script by issuing `./setup.sh` and fill in the values. 
**Important:** You can choose a clear background (1) or a rounded, darker background (2)
